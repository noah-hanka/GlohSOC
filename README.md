UCONN Global Health Hackathon 2021 Project - First Place Submission
This webpage was created during the 24 GlohSOC Hackathon event at UCONN. It is an interactive map of the United States, allowing users to click on a state, or select from a dropdown menu, which then provides 2 links to search queries at the top.
One is a link to relevant refugee news within that state, the other provides refugee charities within that state that users can donate to.
The concept of this project is to make it easier for people to provide to their local communities, and improve refugee health conditions.
